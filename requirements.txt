What is required to install for this project:

pip install -r requirements.txt (installs the packages referred in the requirements.txt document)

steps:
    1- create virtualenv with the command: 
            python -m venv environment

        Running this command creates the target directory (creating any parent directories that donâ€™t exist already) 
        and places a pyvenv.cfg file in it with a home key pointing to the Python installation from which the command 
        was run. It also creates a bin (or Scripts on Windows) subdirectory containing a copy of the python binary 
        (or binaries, in the case of Windows). It also creates an (initially empty) lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages 
        subdirectory (on Windows, this is Lib\site-packages).
        If an existing directory is specified, it will be re-used.

        Deprecated since version 3.6: pyvenv was the recommended tool for creating virtual environments for Python 3.3 
        and 3.4, and is deprecated in Python 3.6.

        Changed in version 3.5: The use of venv is now recommended for creating virtual environments.
